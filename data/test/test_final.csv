Great orientation by the instructor.  Well paced and did a good job with the online engagement piece.,polite,LMS,
"Very eye opening.  It applies to every aspect of your life, work, family, friends.  Worth the time.",polite,LMS,
"The content of the course would've been invaluable were the Institution  in a business of personal growth, family/marriage counseling, self-help, etc. I'm not saying it's not useful, but trying to not hurt other people's feelings is not necessarily how we become industry leaders and innovators (consider Steve Jobs or Elon Musk). I'll probably not get many to agree with me, which is fine. And I'm not saying the course is not useful, but why in the world do we need to spend four hours in a classroom, mostly watching videos and participating in the silly exercises? Do we really need an exercise to illustrate that it's not good to be a distracted listener? Are we five year olds? There is absolutely no reason why this could not be turned into an 1-1.5 hour long online course, which would be a much better use of our time (and people willing to take it in a group setting should have this option, too).",impolite,LMS,

"Good and useful information for safety using noble gases and information provided in small ""chunks"".  The slides had some interactive elements.  Jargon without explanations are minimal.  There's pictures that show and help describe processes and PPE.  The graphics look modern and clean.  The process to submit a quiz question is clunky though - you have to click on a tiny check box outside the margin of the quiz; this keeps me from rating this 5 stars.  I honestly wish this course was longer and went into even more detail because of it's higher than average quality.",polite,LMS,
There was text overlapping making it hard to read. The videos were hard to see do to turning white for some reason. I had a slide that kept skipping to the next one. This course should be redone.,neutral,LMS,

"The content delivery itself was fine, but the quiz and knowledge checks remove opportunity for on the spot learning because they do not display the correct answer when you get one wrong. The given options for the safety systems questions are similarly worded, so you're choosing the ""best"" answer rather than the singularly correct one. Knowing the more correct answer would be nice.",somewhat polite,LMS,
The quiz content is very specific (tactical steps) but then you have to acknowledge that it changes frequently and to always use the up to date job aids. Not a good use of time that could be better spent prepping to teach the course.,neutral,LMS,
Perfectly designed,polite,LMS,
"The course was good. The links need to be updated. Inclusion is migrating to a Sharepoint and the links are old, sometimes containing no content.",neutral,LMS,
"Mercifully short, but NOT for those new to version control.  If you're just starting out, the admonitions will not make any sense at all.  A course on version control should be a prerequisite.",impolite,LMS,

Useful information put together to provide a glance at HR services. Thank you,polite,LMS,
 Here's my constructive feedback: 1.  Two questions have a font significantly smaller than the rest. 2. The question on updating No Shows for prereqs has an answer that is not found in the job aids.  The quiz says move to waitlist.  The most recent job aid says that learner should be marked Unsuccessful. 18yrs taking classes at the Institution & this was the worst ever.  Giving people a stack of documents & a quiz is not teaching people how to use the tools for instructors.  I am sure the course owner will take these comments & improve this course.,somewhat polite,LMS,

"Horrible. Would rate 0 if I could. Most of the questions made no sense, had more than one answer when it didn't say I needed more than one, and some of the questions you couldn't even find the answer to in the training. It's just garbage and needs to be redone",impolite,LMS,
"An Inner source page should be created with the reporting links and these rules. RIght now all I can find is an informal, unofficial BKM someone created (without these security tips)",neutral,LMS,
Why UI has these red-crossed elements at all? Just remove or grey out them.,somewhat polite,LMS,
Waste of time. Just give us simple short instructions to read.  A course for this is just dumb.,impolite,LMS,
Course does its best to offset a system with poorly chosen defaults. This is an information leak waiting to happen. A user should have to very explicitly opt-in to sharing information in public.,impolite,LMS,
Fine refresher for Onboarding,somewhat polite,LMS,
Great course. The video lectures were very interesting. Also the interactive sessions in between were very nice.,polite,LMS,
This course was pretty decent.  My only gripe with it is that you have to click next and cannot click on the side menu to advance the slides.  To further enhance the accessibility of this course I'd suggest re-time captioning for the audio vs. a transcript.,neutral,LMS,
The test out at 100% is ridiculous and will just waste your time if you miss a single question. It then also does not cover what you missed but you have to do the whole course. Very wasteful of my time.,impolite,LMS,
"good refresher, instructor presentation was easy to understand",polite,LMS,
Thank you for this experience. There is so much more that I have seen in the last few days. It truly seems to be a skill to develop long term - thank you for giving me a new perspective and vocabulary.,polite,LMS,
So much fun it's like a flash-based internet game from the 90s,somewhat polite,LMS,
This is very much user friendly.,polite,LMS,
"For a course titled, ""Dos and Donts"", it only really had ""Donts"" and how to report it if someone else accomplished one of these ""Donts"". I'm not sure the course would add any value to those unfamiliar with version control. I appreciated that it was short.",somewhat polite,LMS,
Excellent Session. The instructor was well aware and very patient.,polite,LMS,
The audio is either loud or really quiet.,neutral,LMS,
"I choose to interpret this course as an exercise in the absurdist nihilism of the corporate world, and thus am giving it five stars for the excellent job it has done.",somewhat polite,LMS,
Not the best time to have this considering the turmoil,somewhat polite,LMS,
"THE BEST class I've ever taken at the Institution (and I've been with the Institution 16 years!). Instructor was very knowledgeable, and made the class very entertaining and engaging. I would highly recommend the class.",polite,LMS,
"Very useful information. When something happens, it's good to have a decent understanding of what should be going on to get FABs and buildings operating again.",polite,LMS,
3 of the 4 links in the mental wellness resources page were 404,neutral,LMS,
"Terrible course, there are many users new to the platform, and this course will probably not help them at all. Where are the ""Dos"" to talk about some examples of properly using the website?",impolite,LMS,
Great class! My instructors were very knowledgeable and helpful through out the whole tour.,polite,LMS,
Thank you very much for this course.. Very well taught =),polite,LMS,
Confine Space is no joke and glad to go over the material again. I found this module to be first-rate information.,polite,LMS,
"very well presented, and enabled maximum participation",polite,LMS,
Good disussion and left me thinking about how to be more inclusive,somewhat polite,LMS,
There are too many classes with overlapping material. This course didn't present any new information regarding ergonomic safety that I hadn't already covered in other trainings. The question which asked about adjusting a chair before you start working in a standing position does not seem logical.,neutral,LMS,
Very good training. The very thought process of designing such a training was very nice of the Institution. Reaffirms the Institution's commitment to an inclusive workplace,polite,LMS,
"I'd give it 0 stars if I could, the best training for wasting an the Institution's employee's time.",impolite,LMS,
"Outstanding course and instructor.  This course should be required for employees at all levels.  In a time where diversity and inclusion are important parts of a corporate culture, this course is a great way to improve communication and maintain a strong agreement with others as well as ourselves.",polite,LMS,
"Very good class, subject matter was extremely important. Slide information made it easy to retain information for end of course Test.",polite,LMS,
It's questionable the value to make people to go thru the course/quiz. Simply provide the MUST-FOLLOW instructions and guidance on shipment is more appreciated.,somewhat polite,LMS,
The course itself is good. Short and to the point. But they need to collaborate with others to speed up reporting status to decrease provisioning time and avoid losing more work time,somewhat polite,LMS,
"The question about the broken leg's answer didn't seem to make sense, but asside from that, this course was fine.",somewhat polite,LMS,
Fun activity and I learned quite a bit!,polite,LMS,
Good information for getting started. Thanks!,polite,LMS,
More of an ad. Waste of time.,impolite,LMS,
Videos need a scrub bar and pause option.,neutral,LMS,
Such an informative session ! will be good to say because of the instructor efforts only the session was much useful . Instructor took extra effort to make the things so clear to the participants ! well cone,polite,LMS,
It's a nice awareness that i learnt about this.,polite,LMS,
"Mainly for those who know ""classic"" software dev and want to know what is different in the newer ""Software Dev Essentials"". But it is also a useful overview for those not familiar with software development",neutral,LMS,
"I remember in 1st grade when I had to follow with my finger while someone read painfully slowly.  I don't enjoy it any more now, and it's counter productive if you want people to pay attention to the content.",somewhat polite,LMS,
Could improve - its a duplicity of training taken when onboarding the organization.,neutral,LMS,
It would have been even better if videos were included to reinforce best practices,polite,LMS,
Good platform to learn security awareness,somewhat polite,LMS,
